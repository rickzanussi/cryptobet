## User Interface Requirements
  ### Run app on a dev server locally for testing/grading (connecting to Rinkeby if required)
  Application is made with Truffle. The strcuture of library in GitHub reflect the structure of Truffle. It was programmed with Visual Code on Ubuntu 16.04. On my test environment, it answer to COMPILE, MIGRATE and TEST commands. It is mandatory launch ganache-cli before 
  
  ### Should be able to visit a URL and interact with the app (can be localhost)

  ### The applications should have the following features:
    #### Display the current account
    #### Sign transactions using metamask / uPort
    #### Reflect updates to to the contract state

## Testing
  ### 5 tests (Javascript or Solidity or both) with explanations for each smart contract written (where appropriate)
  ### Tests are properly structured (ie sets up context, executes a call on  the function to be tested, and verifies the result is correct)
  ### Tests provide adequate coverage for the contracts
  ### All tests pass

## Design Pattern Requirements
  ### Implement a circuit breaker / emergency stop
  ### What other design patterns have you used or  not used?

## Security Tools / Common Attacks
  ### Explain what measures theyâ€™ve taken to ensure that their contracts are not susceptible to common attacks

## Library / EthPM
  ### At least one of the project contracts includes an import from a library/contract or an ethPM package

## Additional Requirements
 ### Smart Contract code should be commented  according to the specs in the documentation https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/layout-of-source-files.html#comments

## Stretch Goals for bonus points
  ### Project uses IPFS
  ### Project uses uPort
  ### Project uses the Ethereum Name Service
  ### Project uses an Oracle
  ### Project implements an Upgradable Pattern Registry or Delegation
  ### Project includes one of their smart contracts implemented in LLL / Vyper
  ### Testnet Deployment:  The addresses provided in deployed_addresses.txt correctly point to deployed  contracts on the rinkeby testnet
